# rock-paper-scissors

Following The Odin Project course, this project is a simple rock-paper-scissor that plays only in the terminal.

This project is being made with the intention to practice Javascript and learn in the way of making it.

Later on this project will be updated with a proper interface.

After having a deeper understanding of the Javascript language, I added a visual interface to the game.
